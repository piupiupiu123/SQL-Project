A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.\n\nThe study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.\n\n\nExplore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.\n\nHere is a data description of the columns you may find helpful.","metadata":{},"id":"dbd633ea-2c0a-4bac-a6fe-0cc86896162b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"| Field Name    | Description                                      |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| `inter_dom`     | Types of students (international or domestic)   |\n| `japanese_cate` | Japanese language proficiency                    |\n| `english_cate`  | English language proficiency                     |\n| `academic`      | Current academic level (undergraduate or graduate) |\n| `age`           | Current age of student                           |\n| `stay`          | Current length of stay in years                  |\n| `todep`         | Total score of depression (PHQ-9 test)           |\n| `tosc`          | Total score of social connectedness (SCS test)   |\n| `toas`          | Total score of acculturative stress (ASISS test) |","metadata":{},"id":"167d9c0e-7aba-4e44-99e3-679159e28970","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"-- Run this code to save the CSV file as students\nSELECT * \nFROM 'students.csv';","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"students","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"type":"dataframesAndCsvs"},"executionTime":1413,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"-- Run this code to save the CSV file as students\nSELECT * \nFROM 'students.csv';"},"id":"a60a4d75-634c-4965-8e01-804780e6df98","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"source":"-- Start coding here...","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"type":"dataframesAndCsvs"}},"id":"ab01f727-3ae9-491a-bf8b-6d507e7dbf15","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
